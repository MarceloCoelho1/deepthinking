Welcome to my new blog! This is the inaugural post, a place to set the stage for what's to come.

As I mentioned on the homepage, I believe the best way to master a craft is to understand its core. This blog is my digital workshop for doing just thatâ€”a place where I build concepts from scratch to truly understand them.

Here, you'll find deep dives into topics like:
- **Operating Systems** 
- **Machine Learning** 
- **Software Design** 
- **Cs Theory**
- **Mathematical & Statistical**
