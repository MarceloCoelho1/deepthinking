  <h2>Hi, I'm Marcelo.</h2>

  <p>
    I've always been driven by a deep-seated curiosity about how things work.
    Not just in technology, but in the world at large. This curiosity led me to
    software, and my focus on its core principles—logic, structure, and
    systems—has now evolved into formal research in Machine Learning. This blog
    is simply a public reflection of that ongoing exploration.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course, life is about more than just a computer screen. When I'm not
    thinking about code or architecture, I'm probably diving into a video game
    (yep, haha). Beyond that, I love the simple things: getting lost in a
    bookstore, grabbing a good coffee, and reading books on topics that have
    nothing to do with tech.
  </p>

  <p>
    This space is as much for my own learning as it is for sharing. It's where I
    build my understanding by trying to explain things clearly. If my journey
    resonates with you, or if you'd just rather see something different instead of lines
    of code, feel free to connect.
